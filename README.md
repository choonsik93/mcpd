This codebase is implemented using [CPD](https://github.com/siavashk/pycpd).

## Setup
The code can be run under any environment with Python 3.7 and above.
(It may run with lower versions, but we have not tested it).

We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and setting up an environment:

    conda create --name mcpd python=3.7

Next, install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
